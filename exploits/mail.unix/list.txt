Exploitation in Ubuntu's RoundCube mailing protocol:

Explanation:
Roundcube Webmail before 1.5.10 and 1.6.x before 1.6.11 allows remote code execution by authenticated users,
because the _from parameter in a URL is not validated in program/actions/settings/upload.php. This can lead to PHP Object Deserialization, which can lead to system faults and potential RCE.

Usage:
python3 exploit.py <url> <username> <password> <command> 

Mitigation:
The official Ubuntu wiki has information on patching this exploit. This can be found at https://ubuntu.com/security/CVE-2025-49113.
