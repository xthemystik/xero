This is where I deploy and test prototypes and base exploits. I am in the process of removing xframe from my GitHub, and 
this will be its successor as my designated code dump.

Please note that folders ending in ".x" are a class of exploit based around whatever x is. For example, smbv3.comp is a compression exploit in the SMBv3.11 messaging protocol, hax.ai are exploits in relation to AI, and smtp.unix is an exploit in the SendMail protocol in RedHat Linux.
